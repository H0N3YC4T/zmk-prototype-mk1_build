Some notes, I doubt anyone will want anything from here, but whatever.

There are some differences between the code and the kikad files, I made a few mistakes:
  Right side had an inverted collum mapping (Fixed in kikad, but my ordered pcbs have the error, so the code doesnt match)


Probably other stuff, idk, double check my garbage.
